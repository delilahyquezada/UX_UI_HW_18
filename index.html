    <p>Delilah Quezada is  originally from El Paso, TX. She  grew up on the border and was exposed to different cultures at an early age, sparking an interest in human beings. Her passion for anthropology acted as the perfect catalyst  for expressing creativity and human empathy  in UX UI design. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Delilah finds purpose in learning how technology and humans interact in all variety of mediums. She is also an artist and has enjoyed creating abstract work since she was a teenager. Uniting the world of humans, design, and technology has truly been a humbling and invigorating experience for her.
